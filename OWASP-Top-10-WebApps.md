# OWASP Top 10 for Application Security (2021)  
This document lists the OWASP Top 10 application security risks along with brief recommendations for mitigation.

| **ID** | **Risk** | **Description** | **Recommendations / Mitigations** |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| **A01:2021** | Broken Access Control | Weak or missing enforcement of access controls allows attackers to act outside their intended permissions. | â€¢ Enforce server-side access control checks<br>â€¢ Deny by default and least-privilege access<br>â€¢ Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) and test frequently |
| **A02:2021** | Cryptographic Failures (formerly Sensitive Data Exposure) | Improper use of cryptography leads to exposure of sensitive data in transit or at rest. | â€¢ Use strong, industry-standard encryption (TLS 1.2+, AES-256)<br>â€¢ Disable weak ciphers and protocols<br>â€¢ Do not store sensitive data unless necessary; encrypt at rest |
| **A03:2021** | Injection | Untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, tricking the interpreter into executing unintended commands. | â€¢ Use parameterized queries/prepared statements<br>â€¢ Validate and sanitize input<br>â€¢ Employ ORM frameworks to reduce direct query building |
| **A04:2021** | Insecure Design | Design flaws leave applications vulnerable regardless of implementation correctness. | â€¢ Perform threat modeling during design<br>â€¢ Use secure design patterns and reference architectures<br>â€¢ Incorporate security requirements early in SDLC |
| **A05:2021** | Security Misconfiguration | Insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad-hoc configurations. | â€¢ Harden server and application configurations<br>â€¢ Disable default accounts, sample apps, unnecessary services<br>â€¢ Automate configuration management and use CIS benchmarks |
| **A06:2021** | Vulnerable and Outdated Components | Using components with known vulnerabilities. | â€¢ Maintain an inventory (SBOM) of components<br>â€¢ Regularly scan for vulnerabilities (e.g., SCA tools)<br>â€¢ Apply timely security patches and updates |
| **A07:2021** | Identification and Authentication Failures | Weak or misconfigured authentication mechanisms. | â€¢ Enforce MFA wherever possible<br>â€¢ Store passwords securely (bcrypt/Argon2)<br>â€¢ Implement lockouts, session timeouts, and secure cookie handling |
| **A08:2021** | Software and Data Integrity Failures | Code and data integrity is not verified, leading to unauthorized changes. | â€¢ Use digital signatures and checksums<br>â€¢ Verify updates, plugins, libraries before use<br>â€¢ Employ CI/CD integrity controls |
| **A09:2021** | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | Insufficient logging and monitoring prevents timely detection of breaches. | â€¢ Implement centralized logging and SIEM<br>â€¢ Log authentication failures, access control failures, and server errors<br>â€¢ Establish and test an incident response process |
| **A10:2021** | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) | Applications fetch remote resources without validating user-supplied URLs, enabling attackers to target internal systems. | â€¢ Validate and sanitize all URLs before requests<br>â€¢ Enforce allow-lists for remote destinations<br>â€¢ Isolate SSRF-prone services in network segments |
